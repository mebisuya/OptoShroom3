Repository with all the code used in the manuscript titled "Optogenetic control of apical constriction induces synthetic morphogenesis in mammalian tissues".

This code was meant to be functional for the analysis of the data obtained during this project, so it may not be specially accessible or easy to follow.
However, if you wish to reproduce some of the analysis or repurpose the code for your own data and need help, dont hesitate to contact:
